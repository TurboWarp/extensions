// This will probably fail checks at first, but this is completely blank because I want to
// create the PR without any commits to show development. Not sure if that made sense, it
// probably didn't.

// This will not open in TurboWarp if you click 'Open in TurboWarp'! I'm not sure why, but
// TurboWarp hangs on the loading screen if the extension it wants to load is completely
// empty.
