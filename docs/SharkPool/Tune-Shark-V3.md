# Tune Shark V3
Tune Shark V3 is a powerful audio engine that is built to give you full control over your sounds. It allows you to apply numerous audio effects, precisely measure sound outputs, and more!
This is a remaster of the now deprecated Tune Shark extension by SharkPool.

## General Setup

### Note: All Tune Shark sounds are globally accessible in your project. This means all sprites will be able to access a loaded sound.

```scratch
⚙️ import sound from URL [https://...] named [MySound] ::#666666
```

You can import "Tune Shark" sounds via URL/URI using this block. It is important to note that URLs *must* be a **direct** link to an audio file

```scratch
⚙️ import sound (Meow v) named [MySound] ::#666666
```

Alternatively, you can import "Tune Shark" sounds from pre-existing sounds from the "Sounds" tab in the editor.

```scratch
⚙️ [bind v] sound [MySound] and sound [MySound2] ::#666666
```

This block allows you to bind or unbind the first inputted sound to the second. This means when you play "MySound2", "MySound" will play as well.
This **does not** go the same way in reverse.

```scratch
⚙️ [save v] all sounds to project ::#666666
```

This block saves all currently loaded Tune Shark sounds into the project so that they may be automatically loaded when the project opens.
You can stop this by using the "dont save" option in the block menu.

## Audio Playback

```scratch
🎵 start sound [MySound] ::#666666
```
Similar to Scratch, this will start a sound from the beginning.

```scratch
🎵 start sound [MySound] at time (5) ::#666666
```

You can also start sounds at certain points in the track using this block. This is measured in seconds.

```scratch
🎵 start sound [MySound] at time (0) and stop at (2) ::#666666
```

Similar to the above block, this block will start a sound at a certain point, then **waits** until the sound reaches the stopping point.

```scratch
🎵 stop sound [MySound] ::#666666
```

This block will stop the inputted sound.

```scratch
🎵 [pause v] sound [MySound] ::#666666
```

This block will pause/unpause the inputted sound.

```scratch
🎵 [start v] all sounds ::#666666
```

This block controls all loaded sounds. You can:
- start all sounds
- stop all sounds
- pause all sounds
- unpause all sounds

## Operations

```scratch
⚙️ toggle sound link to @greenFlag @stopSign [on v] ::#666666
```

Toggling this operator on will cause Tune Shark sounds to stop when the green flag or stop sign is clicked.

```scratch
⚙️ toggle sound [MySound] overlapping [on v] ::#666666
```

Toggling this operator on will allow multiple instances of a sound to play at once.
Normally, you can only play one instance of a sound at a time.

```scratch
⚙️ toggle sound [MySound] reverse mode [on v] ::#666666
```

Toggling this operator on will make the inputted ound play in reverse. Toggling it off will return it back to normal.

```scratch
⚙️ toggle sound [MySound] looping [on v] ::#666666
```

Toggling this operator on will allow the inputted sound to loop.

```scratch
⚙️ sound [MySound] loop start (0) end (2) ::#666666
```

You can mess around with the loop starting point and ending point with this block.

```scratch
⚙️ delete sound [MySound] ::#666666
```

This block will delete the inputted sound.

```scratch
⚙️ delete all sounds ::#666666
```

This block will delete all loaded sounds.

```scratch
(⚙️ all sounds ::#666666)
```

This block will return an array of the names of all loaded Tune Shark sounds.

```scratch
(⚙️ all playing sounds ::#666666)
```

Similarly, this block returns an array of the names of all loaded Tune Shark sounds that are currently playing.

```scratch
⚙️ when sound [MySound] [starts v] ::#666666 hat
```

This event block runs whenever the inputted sound starts or ends.

```scratch
<⚙️ sound [MySound] (exists v)? ::#666666>
```

Returns various information of a sound:
Options | What they Check for
--- | ---
exists | if the sound exists
playing | if the sound is playing
paused | if the sound is paused
looped | if the sound is looping
overlaped | if the sound allows instancing
reversed | if the sound is reversed
binded | if the sound is binded to another

```scratch
(⚙️ (length v) of sound [MySound] ::#666666)
```

Returns various information of a sound:
Options | What they Do
--- | ---
length | sound length (in seconds)
current time | current position in a sound
source | source URL/URI of a sound
estimated bpm | estimated beats-per-minute
channels | the number of [channels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_concepts) in a sound
binds | an array of sound names binded to this sound
*...various audio effects* | returns the inputted parameters for the effect

```scratch
(⚙️ [loudness v] of sound [MySound] at time (0) in channel (1) ::#666666)
```

You can read sound outputs using this block.

If you select **"loudness"**, it returns a normalized volume of the outputted noise at a specific point in the sound.

Similarly, **"raw noise"** returns the outputted volume, but its *not normalized*

Selecting **"tone"** will return the outputted pitch of a sound at a specific point.


The channel input selects which [sound channel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_concepts) to extract the output data from.
Typically, if there are 2 channels, channel 1 is "Left Ear" and channel 2 is "Right Ear".

## Audio Effects

```scratch
🎛️ set volume of sound [MySound] to (100) ::#666666
```

This block simply sets the volume of the inputted sound.

```scratch
🎛️ reset (all effects v) of sound [MySound] ::#666666
```

This block resets the values of each audio effect in a sound to the default (not including volume).

```scratch
🎛️ set (pitch v) of sound [MySound] to (0) ::#666666
```

Sets the effect of a selected sound to a inputted value.
Effect List | What they Do
--- | ---
pitch | changes the speed and tone of the sound
detune | changes the speed and semitone of the sound
speed | changes the speed of the sound without affecting pitch
pan | shifts sound to the left (negative) or right (positive) ear
gain | boosts the sounds volume beyond 100
distortion | distorts/crushes sound
attack | fade-in time when sound starts
release | fade-out time when sound stops

```scratch
🎛️ set reverb of sound [MySound] to time (100) decay (100) mix (50) ::#666666
```

Adds reverb to an inputted sound.

**Warning:** Initializing reverb can cause framerate drops as its heavy to setup. For dynamic on/off use, you can use the Delay effect
Parameters | What they Do
--- | ---
time | the length (or room space) of the reverb effect
decay	| the rate of how long the reverb fades over time
mix	| percentage of how dry or wet the sound is

```scratch
🎛️ set delay of sound [MySound] to time (50) feedback (60) mix (50) ::#666666
```

Adds an echoing delay effect to a sound.

Parameters | What they Do
--- | ---
time | interval between each echo
feedback | intensity of each subsequent echo
mix	| percentage of the original sound and the delayed sound

```scratch
🎛️ set tremolo of sound [MySound] to speed (35) depth (80) mix (100) ::#666666
```

Modulates the volume of a sound periodically, creating a tremolo effect.

Parameters | What they Do
--- | ---
speed | how fast the volume fluctuates
depth | intensity of the volume variation. A higher depth means more dramatic volume changes
mix	| amount of the tremolo effect applied

```scratch
🎛️ set fuzz of sound [MySound] to low (60) med-low (50) med-high (80) high (60) mix (50) ::#666666

```scratch
🎛️ set bitcrush of sound [MySound] to bits (65) freq (60000) ::#666666
```

Reduces a sound's resolution and frequency, creating a chiptune-like, retro effect.

Parameters | What they Do
--- | ---
bits | bit depth. Lower values result in more distortion
freq | sampling frequency. Lower values create a grittier effect

```scratch
🎛️ set [highpass v] of sound [MySound] to frequency (400) peak (10) ::#666666
```

Highpass: Filters out lower frequencies below the specified cutoff, allowing higher frequencies to pass through.
