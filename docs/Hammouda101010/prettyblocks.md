# Pretty Blocks
An extension to add strict formatting rules to your project. 
## Rules
- Camel Case Only:
  - Affects all variables and sprites.
  - Forces the "CamelCase" naming convention.
- Griffpatch Style:
  - Affects variables only.
  - Makes sure that global variables are in "uppercase" and local variables in "lowercase". much like how [griffpatch](https://www.youtube.com/@griffpatch) writes his variables.
- No Capitalized Custom Blocks:
  - Affects custom blocks only.
  - Makes sure that custom block names aren't capitalized.
